## HTML5 Web Storage

Web Storage(sessionStorage and localStorage) is a new HTML5 API offering important benefits over traditional cookies. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie. We Storages can store far larger data (at least 5MB) and never transferred to the server. All sites from the same or one origin can store and access the same data.

The data being stored can be accessed using JavaScript, which gives you the ability to leverage client-side scripting to do many things that have traditionally involved server-side programming and relational databases. There are two Web Storage objects:

# sessionStorage
# localStorage

localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.

It should be noted that data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page.
