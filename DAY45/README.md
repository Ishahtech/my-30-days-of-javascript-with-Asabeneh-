## HTML5 Web Storage Objects
HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:

window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)Most modern browsers support Web Storage, however it is good to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage. Let us see the available methods for the Web Storage objects.
Web Storage objects:

localStorage - to display the localStorage object
localStorage.clear() - to remove everything in the local storage
localStorage.setItem() - to store data in the localStorage. It takes a key and a value parameters.
localStorage.getItem() - to display data stored in the localStorage. It takes a key as a parameter.
localStorage.removeItem() - to remove stored item form a localStorage. It takes key as a parameter.
localStorage.key() - to display a data stored in a localStorage. It takes index as a parameter.

## Setting item to the localStorage
When we set data to be stored in a localStorage, it will be stored as a string. If we are storing an array or an object, we should stringify it first to keep the format unless otherwise we lose the array structure or the object structure of the original data.

We store data in the localStorage using the localStorage.setItem method.
