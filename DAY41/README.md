## ðŸš€ Day 41 of my #100DaysOfCodeChallenge journey! ðŸ’»



Today, I continued my #JavaScript learning by diving deeper into classes. I explored the getter and setter methods, understanding how to use them to control access to object properties. 



Then, I learned about the static keyword, which defines a static method for a class. Static methods, such as Date.now(), are called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. These methods often serve as utility functions.



After three solid hours of learning, I challenged my understanding by taking up the exercises attached to this module. I successfully solved the level 1 and 2 tasks and am currently breezing through level 3.



Quote of the day: "The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you." - B.B. King



This quote reminds us that the knowledge and skills we acquire are ours forever, empowering us to achieve great things.
